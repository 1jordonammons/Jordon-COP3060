    Hello, I am  Jordon Ammons. I’m a student leader and CS scholar who enjoys building community on campus and exploring different software projects in my free time. I also love going to the gym and meeting new people. I’m passionate about creating spaces where people feel supported and motivated, whether through leadership roles, mentoring, or working on projects that bring value to others. One day, I hope to get a software engineering or product management job. A fun fact about me is that I ran in the Junior Olympics when I was younger.
