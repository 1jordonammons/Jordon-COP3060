# PA02: JavaScript (Part 2)

## Overview
This project adds JavaScript interactivity and a simple Fetch data flow to a personal introduction webpage. It demonstrates input validation, DOM manipulation, event handling, loops, fetch requests, error handling, and filtering/sorting data from a public API.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser, or use a local server such as VS Code Live Server.
3. Make sure `app.js` is in the same folder as `index.html`.

## How to Test
- **Console:** Open DevTools and check for the welcome message. No errors should appear.
- **Validation:** Submit an email in the form. A success or error message will show below the form (no alerts).
- **Loop Rendering:** A list of 5 quick tips should appear in the “Quick Tips” section, generated by JavaScript.
- **Fetch:** Click **Load Data** to load and display at least 10 posts from a public API.
- **Filter & Sort:** Use the search box to filter the data and the dropdown to sort titles A–Z or Z–A.
- **Error Handling:** Disconnect from the internet and click **Load Data** to see an error message.
- **Empty Results:** Type random text into the filter box to trigger the “No results found” state.
